      "you.\"The child further inquired, \"Here in heaven all I have to do is sing and \n",
      "smile to be happy, what happens when I go to earth?\"   God said, \"Your angel \n",
      "will sing for you and smile for you every day. You will feel your angel's \n",
      "love and be very happy.\"Again the child asked, \"I don't know the language, how will I understand when \n",
      "people talk to me?\"   God said, \"Your angel will tell you the most beautiful \n",
      "and sweet words you will ever hear and with much patience and care, teach you \n",
      "how to speak.\"\"And what am I going to do when I want to talk to you?\"   God said, \"Your \n",
      "angel will place your hands together and teach you how to pray.\"\"I've heard there are bad men on Earth, who will protect me?\"  God said, \n",
      "\"Your angel will defend you, and even risk its life for you.\"\"I will not see you anymore, and I will be sad.\"    God said \"Your angel will \n",
      "talk to you about me and teach you the way to come back to me.  I will always \n",
      "be next to you.\"At that moment there was much peace in heaven, but voices from Earth could be \n",
      "heard, and the child hurriedly asked, \"God, it's time for me to leave now, \n",
      "will you please tell me my angel's name?\"    God replied, \"Her name is not \n",
      "important, you will simply call her Mom.\"\n",

      "1)   On October 26, FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert spoke on \"Competition &\n",
      "America's Energy Policy\" to group of Houston industry executives, addressing \n",
      "the\n",
      "merits and problems with electricity deregulation.\n",
      "2)   Commissioner Hebert, the sole Republican, supports a comprehensive energy\n",
      "policy, renewable fuel use, improved pipeline certification, and flexibility,\n",
      "but opposes price controls and free market intervention.\n",
      "3)   Last week, the California ISO called on the FERC to rule on a \"market\n",
      "stabilization plan\" that would affectively cap the price electricity at \n",
      "$100/mWh\n",
      "unless 70% of the power generated is sold forward within the state.\n",

      "Energy is one of the leading topics in the approaching general elections and\n",

      "contention.\n",
      "Regional shortages have resulted in spikes in the price of electricity, and\n",
      "this past summer, hot weather in the western U.S. sent electricity prices\n",
      "soaring.  In California, where the rate payers served by PG&E and Edison\n",

      "state regulators are calling for more government involvement.In California several proposals are on the table:\n",
      "1)   A consumer group has called for the \"excessive\" profits earned by\n",
      "generators and marketers this past summer to be retroactively refunded to\n",
      "ratepayers.  .\n",
      "2)   U.S. Rep. Bob Finer, D-California, introduced a bill to the House that\n",
      "would create disincentives for power companies to earn profits, imposing a\n",
      "windfall profits tax on wholesale power sold in the western U.S.\n",
      "3)   As recently as last night, October 26, the California Independent System\n",
      "Operator (ISO) implemented an interim measure that imposes hourly price caps \n",
      "on\n",
      "generators based on forecasted load and arbitrary heat rates ranging between\n",
      "negative $100/MWh and positive $250/MWh.  Effective on 11/3, the proposal\n",
      "essentially shuts down the peaking generation plants which would not be able \n",
      "to\n",
      "economically produce power within the state.\n",
      "4)   California ISO staff has also proposed to impose a \"bid\" cap on \n",
      "electricity\n",
      "of $100/mWh on power generators and marketers in the state that do not comply\n",
      "with the requirement of selling 70% of their load under forward contracts \n",

      "violators\n",
      "would be subjected to the $100 bid cap.\n",
      "5)   California plans to require interruptible users of power to extend their\n",
      "contracts, preventing these end users from switching to firm contracts, thus\n",
      "ensuring that certain customers can be shut off in the event of a power\n",

      "recent electricity price spikes in the West this past summer were great market\n",
      "indicators that electric generation is in short supply, particularly during\n",
      "periods of hot weather.  In the summer of 1999, the Midwest experienced \n",
      "similar\n",
      "price spikes also related to summer heat.  The difference between the two\n",
      "situations is that the Midwest allowed the market to decide, which responded\n",

      "electricity that have had the affect of discouraging new generation.  Thus, \n",
      "the\n",

      "send\n",
      "to the electricity industry a signal on what may make the markets work, and\n",
      "believe that any plan should be \"bold, ambitious and strict\" in requiring\n",

      "not\n",
